k6lint `v0.3.1` is here ðŸŽ‰!

Tweaks in this release:

## types checker

Search for the `index.d.ts` file in the `api-docs` folder as well (not only in the `docs` and root folders).

## smoke checker

Search for the smoke test script in the `scripts` folder as well (not only in the `test`, `tests`, `examples` and root folder).

## build checker

The check should not fail if the module path of the extension is not included in the output of the version command.
