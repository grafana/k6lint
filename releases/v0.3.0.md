k6lint `v0.3.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This version adds two new checkers to the linter:
- **types checker**
- **codeowners checker**

Improvements:
- The `examples` and `smoke` checks are skipped in the case of output extensions.

## types checker

The check is successful if there is TypeScript API declaration file with name `index.d.ts` in `docs` directory or in the base directory.

## codeowners checker

The check is successful if there is a `CODEOWNERS` file in one of the GitHub supported directories: `.github` or `docs` or base directory.

The `codeowners` check is only executed if the `--official` flag is used (or if the `Official` API parameter is `true`).
