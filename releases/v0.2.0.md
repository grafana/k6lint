k6lint `v0.2.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This version adds two new checkers to the linter:
- **build checker**
- **smoke checker**

## build checker

The check is successful if the extension can be built with the latest k6 release.

## smoke checker

The check is successful if there is a smoke test script and it runs successfully with the k6 built with the extension.

Obviously, a prerequisite for a successful run is that the build checker runs successfully, otherwise k6 cannot be built with the extension.

The smoke test script file is searched for in the root of the repository and in the `test`,`tests`,`examples` directories. The name of the smoke test script is one of the following:
  - `smoke.js`
  - `smoke.ts`
  - `smoke.test.js`
  - `smoke.test.ts`
